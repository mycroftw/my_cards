# my_cards
ACBL 2022 convention cards (src and pdf) for me and my partners (and their partners)
Made with [mycroftw/conv-cards](https://github.com/mycroftw/conv-cards) template.

## List of cards

<!-- Find an auto-creator that will update on demand or even on pre-push.
     It does look like `gitdown` will happily make things; and then have
     something that hooks into the pycharm git push?
-->

- [CarolC](out/CarolC.pdf) - Mycroft and Ellen's card with Carol.
- [Ellen K/S](out/MF-EK-KS.pdf) - Our "normal" system.  K/S (2/1, weak NT) with Keri, Power Doubles and other weirdness.
- [Ellen EHAA](out/Ellen-EHAA.pdf) - When we're being weird, or when the opponents complain our normal system is
  "just played to confuse."  Very aggressive preempts, very sound constructive openers, more natural than your system.
- [Janet](out/Janet.pdf) - JanetG 2/1 with Toronto influences.
- [Jimmy](out/MF-JR.pdf) - Pretty standard Lakeside 2/1.
- [Marcia](out/Marcia.pdf) - Calgary 2/1
- [Tom N](out/MF-TomN.pdf) - Bernie-standard 2/1, played with Tom in Calgary.
