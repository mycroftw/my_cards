## List of cards

- [EK-Lois](out/EK-Lois.pdf): Ellen with Lois.  2/1 Calgary style.
- [Ellen-EHAA](out/Ellen-EHAA.pdf): When we're being weird, or when the opponents complain our normal system is "just played to confuse". Very aggressive preempts, very sound constructive openers, more natural than your system.
